Questions and answers to a famous coding platform.

## Deployment

This project has been built on Python 3.9.
There are no dependencies beyond the standard libraries of Python.

However, in order, linting and auto-formatting libraries were used to improve the readability of the code.
These can be found in the `requirements/dev.txt` folder of the project. None of the non-standard libraries used were in any way of help for answering the coding questions (beyond linting).
